# Faction Variety Project - Pike and Shot

First in a series of (planned) mods that aims to add more variety to the factions in the Rim.
It plans to do so by turning various content mods created by the talented Rimworld modders into thematic factions.

This faction is built around [Tastier Armory - Pike and Shot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3303114261)
